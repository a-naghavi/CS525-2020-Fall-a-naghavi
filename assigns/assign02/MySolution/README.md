The functions that are asked in the assign02 are totally implemented and you can see their example output by calling make and executing the output file.

Just use following commands in this directory to show the output:
```
make
./assign02_sol
```

The functions in files lambda0_print.dats, lambda0_interp.dats are changed to support the T0Mtup, and T0Mprj. Furthermore, the coin_change and coin_get functions are implemented in both lambda0 and ATS. The result of the both of these implementation is compaired for the value 300 as argument . The lambda0 implementation is in assign02_sol.dats and the ATS implementaion is in fcoin_change.dats.
