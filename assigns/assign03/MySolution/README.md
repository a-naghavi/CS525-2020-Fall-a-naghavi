The functions that are asked in the assign03 are totally implemented and you can see their example output by calling make and executing the output file.

Just use following commands in this directory to show the output:
```
make
./lambda2
```

The function t0erm_tcheck0 is updated to support following terms T0Mfix, T0Mopr1, T0Mopr2, T0Mcond, T0Mfst, T0Msnd. Then function coin_change is implemented by lambda2 and it is type checked using t0erm_tcheck0. Furthermore, just to show terms by print the function fprint_t0erm is implemented.
